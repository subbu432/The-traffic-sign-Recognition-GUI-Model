# The-Traffic-sign-Recognition-GUI-Model
  
      This is a  Traffic sign Recognition project, in this project i build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs
      present in the image into different categories. With the help of this model, we can read and understand 
      traffic signs.This project is very helpful for autonomous vehicles.![Traffic sign classification 02-08-2021 12_19_52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82407789/127817179-de5e5efd-5b3b-4482-9a0e-a094d0f07a58.png)
